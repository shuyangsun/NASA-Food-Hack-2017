# WasteNot!

This is a prototype for the machine learning part for project WasteNot! - NYC regional nominee for NASA Space App Challenge 2017.

## Introduction

Believe it or not, 1/3 of all food produced in the US goes to waste. Restaurants and grocery stores alike often throw away expired food that didn’t get used because of bad planning, or overly optimistic outlook on the market.

Using machine learning algorithms, we created an app that makes predictions of consumption for the next week. The app learns individual stores’ order patterns, and fuse that with macro-level live data sets such as weather, market supply, and local events.

Store owners can select factors that have major impacts on their businesses, and gradually train the software to make predictions with higher confidence scores.With the aid of machine learning, the app could save the food industry billions of dollars each year, and help decrease environmental pollutions.
